This includes all program for sentiment analysis
📊 YouTube Comment Analyzer
An NLP-powered tool for extracting, cleaning, and performing sentiment analysis on YouTube video comments.

🌟 Project Overview
This project provides a robust solution for understanding audience sentiment and engagement on YouTube. By leveraging the YouTube Data API and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this tool fetches comments from a specified video URL, processes the raw text, and classifies the expressed opinions into positive, negative, or neutral categories.

Key Goals
Audience Insight: Help content creators and marketers quickly gauge viewer reception to specific videos.

Scalable Analysis: Handle thousands of comments efficiently using Python and data science libraries.

Visualization: Provide clear, interactive visualizations of sentiment trends and keyword distribution.

✨ Features
Comment Extraction: Uses the official YouTube Data API (v3) for reliable data retrieval.

Data Preprocessing: Cleans unstructured text data (stop word removal, tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, handling of emojis and special characters).

Sentiment Analysis: Utilizes a lexicon-based model (e.g., VADER) or a machine learning classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression) for sentiment scoring.

Visualization: Generates distribution plots (pie charts, bar graphs) for overall sentiment and trend analysis.

Top Insights: Identifies the most positive and most negative comments, along with frequently discussed keywords (Topic Modeling).
